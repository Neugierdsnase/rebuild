# Gameplay

Gameplay is really simple. you just have to mimic the right table by moving the red square around in the left table, the red square will leave behind an arrow in the direction you leve the current square. If you get to a square where there is already an arrow, you will override the existing arrow.

# Why

We got an assignment to invent a game (I just went ahead and coded it anyway) only consisting of squares, circles, triangles, arrows and the numbers 0-9. We didn't have to use all of those things, so I only used squares and arrows.
